# Hybrid-CNN-BiLSTM-Model-for-Heart-Murmur-Detection-
-Main Contributions
  -Developed a hybrid deep learning framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM), and attention mechanisms to detect heart murmurs from audio recordings.

  -Utilized smartphone microphone recordings as the data source, enabling accessible and low-cost cardiac screening without specialized medical equipment.

  -Designed a preprocessing pipeline that converts raw audio signals into standardized Mel spectrogram representations for effective feature extraction.

  -Implemented data augmentation and class imbalance handling techniques, such as SMOTE and SpecAugment, to improve model generalization and robustness.

  -Trained and evaluated the model on the PhysioNet CirCor Phonocardiogram dataset, achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and ROC-AUC in binary classification of murmur presence.

  -Incorporated interpretability through attention map visualizations to help understand which sound segments influence the model's decision, facilitating clinical trust.

  -Provided a complete codebase for training, evaluation, and inference to enable replication and further research in mobile health-based cardiac diagnostics.
